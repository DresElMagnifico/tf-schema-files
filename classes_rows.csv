This workshop is held on an auspicious day; the Aries New Moon and Astrological new year.
You will:<br/>
* learn how to harness the 28-day cycle of the moon to manifest<br/>
* receive journal prompts for the different phases of the moon<br/>
* be guided through a deeply rejuvenating Yoga Nidra practice to plant seeds of intention<br/><br/>

Yoga Nidra is a sleep-based meditation that is designed to release tension in the body and mind. It is the perfect practice to completely let go of the day and to clear energy for the new cycle ahead of you.
